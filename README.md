# Beesoc's Easy Linux Loader
Source for my custom BASH menu system

First of all, I am not the author of ANY of these tools that this menu system is installing, configuring or running. I have just put together this BASH menu system to help some non-technical friends utilize Linux, Pwnagotchi's and some pretty sweet Linux tools.

Setup - To install Beesoc's Easy Linux menu system, copy and paste the following command to the Linux Terminal: 
git clone https://github.com/Beesoc/easy-linux.git && cd easy-linux && ./SETUP.sh
