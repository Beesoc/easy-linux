# Beesoc's Easy Linux Loader
Source for my custom BASH menu system.  

## What is it
I am not the author of ANY of the tools that this menu system is installing, configuring or running. I have just put together this BASH menu system to help some non-technical friends utilize Linux, Pwnagotchi's and some pretty sweet Linux tools.  Full credit goes to the respective tool creators.  You all rock!
