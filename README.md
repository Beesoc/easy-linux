# Beesoc's Easy Linux Loader
Source for my custom BASH menu system.  

## What is it
I am not the author of ANY of the tools that this menu system is installing, configuring or running. I have just put together this BASH menu system to help some non-technical friends utilize Linux, Pwnagotchi's and some pretty sweet Linux tools.  Full credit goes to the respective tool creators.  You all rock!

### Setup
To install Beesoc's Easy Linux menu system, copy and paste the following command to the Linux Terminal: 
* **curl -L -o $HOME/compiled/SETUP-easy-linux.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Beesoc/my-configs-public/main/SETUP-easy-linux.sh && ./SETUP-easy-linux.sh**
