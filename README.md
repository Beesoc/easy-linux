# Beesoc's Easy Linux Loader
Source for my custom BASH menu system.  

## What is it
I am not the author of ANY of the tools that this menu system is installing, configuring or running. I have just put together this BASH menu system to help some non-technical friends utilize Linux, Pwnagotchi's and some pretty sweet Linux tools.  Full credit goes to the respective tool creators.  You all rock!

### Setup
*To install Beesoc's Easy Linux menu system, just **clone the repository** and run **SETUP-easy-linux.sh**
Don't know how to do that?  No prob. The purpose of this project is to help non-technical (or, at least non-Linux) people out.  
Detailed instructions: 
1. open a 'Terminal' emulator app on your Linux desktop.
2. in the Terminal window, copy and paste this command: 'git clone 


**IMPORTANT:**  The install command above should be copied and pasted as 1 command!  Seriously, every single letter, EXACTLY!
