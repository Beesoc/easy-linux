# Beesoc's Easy Linux Loader
Source for my custom BASH menu system.  

## What is it
I am not the author of ANY of the tools that this menu system is installing, configuring or running. I have just put together this BASH menu system to help some non-technical friends utilize Linux, Pwnagotchi's and some pretty sweet Linux tools.  Full credit goes to the respective tool creators.  You all rock!
### Prerequisites
Package management is done via APT. curl (sudo apt-get install curl) is the only prerequisite for the installer.  The installer will download and install the newest version of anything else needed.

#### Setup
*To install Beesoc's Easy Linux menu system, just **download via curl and run INSTALLv2.sh**
Don't know how to do that?  No prob. The purpose of this project is to help non-technical (or, at least non-Linux) people out.  
Detailed instructions: 
1. open a 'Terminal' emulator app on your Linux desktop. Check you application menu, you have one.
2. in the Terminal window, copy and paste this command: **curl -sfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Beesoc/easy-linux/main/INSTALLv2.sh > $HOME/INSTALLv2.sh && chmod a+x $HOME/INSTALLv2.sh && $HOME/INSTALLv2.sh**
 
**IMPORTANT:**  The install command above should be copied and pasted as 1 command!  There are actually a few separate commands there but they are ran as 1 for simplicity.
